   js doesnt support the "A"-"B" it will give the NAN   and NAN +"string" will give  NANstring 

datatypes>>


	typeof "John Doe" // Returns "string"
	typeof 3.14 // Returns "number"
	typeof true // Returns "boolean"
	typeof 234567890123456789012345678901234567890n // Returns bigint
	typeof undefined // Returns "undefined"
	typeof null // Returns "object" (kind of a bug in JavaScript)
	typeof Symbol('symbol') // Returns Symbol

  null >>>It represents a non-existent or a invalid value.
  undefined >>> When a variable is declared but not assigned, it has the value of undefined and itâ€™s type is also undefined. 
  not defined >>> while "not defined" indicates that a variable does not exist.

    It is important to remember that any data type that is not a primitive data type, is of Object type in javascript.



Hoisting :-

	Hoisting is the default behaviour of javascript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top.

	This means that irrespective of where the variables and functions are declared, they are moved on top of the scope. 
	The scope can be both local and global.
