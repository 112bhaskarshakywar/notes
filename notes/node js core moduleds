Node js tutorial  by thapa techniacal

node js is a javascript runtime built on chrome v8 js engine. it is a nonblocking application single threaded..
it is not a framework not a liabrary it is just a runtime 


until we are working on js code it is a editor and when we run that code it is a runtime envoironment.

when to use nodejs >>

I/O bound :- means it will be no bloacking kind of work required.

data streaming applications:-  it will show all data jaise jaise apan niche jaenge feed aat hi jaega .. like instagrame


real time chat application

when not to use nodejs >>
	 where cpu intensive work is required  we don't use node js  

	nodejs has another data type called buffer which read bytes 		data


download node js for your pc >>






cmd uses >> for installing linux use command "sudo apt install nodejs"

 

so first code u have to make index.js file in your files to create nodejs server file ..

 and console.log will here only run in the terminal only and not (it wont show on browser).


and to run your files you need to do node filename.js
 in terminal




REPL in node js:-
it is an feature of node ans it is very useful in experimenting with nodekjs codes and to debug javascript codes 


READ:-  reads user input ,parses the input into js datastructure and store in memory
EVAL :- takes and evaluates the data structure
PRINT :- prints the result 
LOOP :- loops the above commanduntil the user presses  ctrl-c twice




REPL is basically cmd(like in windows ) of node js 
to use repl in terminal of vscode just write node in terminal and repl will be on ..  and to come out from that typr ".exit"


and to create folder from terminal just type "type null > index.js"




what we can do in repl
>>
  js expression 9+5 ; 5+(5&5) + 6 :
  use variables 
  multiline code like  do while loops 
  use  (_) to get the last result if u just write _ then it will give last result ;
  .editor>>	entering editor mode (^D to finish ,^C to cancel).

  


It will be in node terminal only
  :-
in repl if you want to find all systems in node just tab two times 
and to  find  methods in each system and type its name and tab





Node js core modules >>
  modules are just as same as js liabraries .
  Node.js has a set of built in which you can use without any further installation.




file system :--

const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile('filename.extension',  data to save , options) 
 // this will  create(if there is no same file ) above file and add data in that (if same ile exsited then just update whole data)

fs.writeFileSync('filename.extension',  data to save , options) 
// this will do same work but only synchrnously.


fs.appendFileSync('filename.extension',  data to save , options) 
 //    just add data 




fs.readFileSync('filename.extension', options) 
// it will give you buffered data type on read  so convert that in the string using toString().   





TO RENAME THE FILE :

fs.renameSync("original_name.extension","new_name.extension");
  //  it will rename file synchronously
